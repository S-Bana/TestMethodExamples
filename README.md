# TestMethodExamples provides a collection of examples and test cases that illustrate how to utilize different testing frameworks in Python. The key features of this repository include:
Doctest: Learn how to integrate documentation and testing by using the doctest module, which allows you to write tests within docstrings. This approach ensures that your documentation remains accurate and executable, making it easier to verify that examples work as intended.
Pytest: Discover the simplicity and power of pytest, a popular testing framework that enables you to write concise test cases with minimal boilerplate code. This section includes examples showcasing pytest's rich features, such as fixtures, parameterized tests, and detailed output for debugging.
Unittest: Explore the built-in unittest framework, which provides a structured approach to writing and running tests in Python. Examples will demonstrate how to create test cases, use assertions, and organize tests into suites.
By providing clear examples and explanations, TestMethodExamples aims to empower developers to adopt best practices in testing, ultimately leading to more robust and maintainable code. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this repository offers valuable insights into the world of Python testing frameworks.
